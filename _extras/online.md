title: Resources for Online Teaching
---
In light of the extenuating circumstances created by Covid-19, many instructors find themselves suddenly teaching lab courses online.  This page is intended to provide extra resources to modify the BASIL curriculum for online access.  If you are considering using or have started using the BASIL curriculum please fill out [this survey](https://rit.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3INVHixqIN0pIS9) to tell us about yourself.

The existing *in silico* BASIL modules could be used in an online or virtual environment.
- [Structural Alignment with PyMOL and ProMOL](https://basilbiochem.github.io/basil/01-pymol-promol/index.html)
- [Protein BLAST Search](https://basilbiochem.github.io/basil/02-blast/index.html)
- [Using Pfam to Predict Protein Function](https://basilbiochem.github.io/basil/03-pfam/index.html)
- [Structural Alignment with Dali](https://basilbiochem.github.io/basil/04-dali/index.html)
- [Molecular Docking with AutoDock VINA and PyRx](https://basilbiochem.github.io/basil/05-pyrx/index.html)

Additional Resources which might be used in place of traditional laboratory activities.  

- [Simulated protein purification activity for biochem lab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hdy8FbkrIJDQKLLbuXZ5ETfZcX9kwLFVH0lGRs28z5A/edit?usp=sharing) This exercise can be used in an online class to substitute for protein purification laboratory activities.  The simulation environment compels students to apply their conceptual knowledge to make decisions related to the protein purification process and provides immediate feedback on these decisions.
