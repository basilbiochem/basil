**Steve Mills** is a biochemist in the Chemistry Department at Xavier University. He teaches Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry. He uses BASIL in his Biochemistry Lab course. His research background is in using enzyme kinetics to determine enzyme mechanisms. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

<img src="../fig/Offerdahl.png" alt="Picture of Erika Offerdahl" width="100" style="float: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 10px" />

**Erika Offerdahl** is a Professor of biochemistry and education researcher at Washington State University. Her research focuses broadly on the mechanisms by which scientific expertise is developed in undergraduates.  Current projects include  (1) studentsâ€™ visualization skills in biochemistry and molecular biology, (2) the role of classroom assessment in supporting the development of scientific expertise, and (3) deliberative argumentation as a vehicle for learning in undergraduate biology.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
