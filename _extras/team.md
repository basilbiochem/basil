**Erika Offerdahl** is a Professor of biochemistry and education researcher at Washington State University. Her research focuses broadly on the mechanisms by which scientific expertise is developed in undergraduates.  Current projects include  (1) studentsâ€™ visualization skills in biochemistry and molecular biology, (2) the role of classroom assessment in supporting the development of scientific expertise, and (3) deliberative argumentation as a vehicle for learning in undergraduate biology.  <br> <br> <br> <br>
