## Interested in Learning More about BASIL? Join us at an Upcoming Event!

#### Introduction to the BASIL Curriculum
In these workshops participants will learn about the distinguishing characteristics of course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), be introduced to the curriculum used to implement BASIL CUREs in diverse institutional contexts, and create an action plan for how to adapt BASIL for your own course. Participants will gain hands-on experience with web-based BASIL resources and guidance in how to assess student learning in BASIL CUREs.  Finally, participants will be invited to join a rich community of biochemists committed to increasing access to undergraduate research. <br>
**Workshop cost:** Free <br>
**Date and Time:** Sept. 24, 2022 and Feb. 23, 2023, virtual on zoom <br>

### Workshops at the [Biennial Conference on Chemical Education](https://www.bcce2022.org/)

#### Assessment Design for Course-Based Undergraduate Reserach Experiences (CUREs)
This workshop will focus on assessment design for Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). Research based courses are notoriously difficult to assess effectively and this difficulty can serve as a hurdle away from adoption. Assessments designed based on the Biochemistry Authentic Scientific Inquiry Lab (BASIL) framework will be shared and discussed. Participants will design learning objectives and outcomes for an assessment and subsequently work to develop assessments that align with those objectives. We will also highlight the power of CUREs, providing a complete framework and implementation strategies for the introduction of this type of instruction into the curriculum. The modules for the entire BASIL based biochemistry lab course are available to any interested instructor. This workshop is aimed at increasing awareness of this student-centered, research-focused style of instruction. <br>
**Workshop cost:** $10. <br>
**Date and time:** TBD (July 31-Aug 4, 2022 at BCCE 2022), Purdue University,  West Lafayette, IN

##### Visualization and Docking of Protein-Ligand Interactions in the Biochemistry Teaching Lab
Biochemistry laboratory courses often focus on protein biochemistry, with an emphasis on purification, concentration measurement, electrophoresis, and kinetics. Along with these in vitro techniques, visualization of a protein's structure can add excitement as well as deepen understanding of the relationship between a proteins structure and its function. This workshop will use approaches developed as part of the BASIL curriculum to combine discovery of functions of unknown proteins within the teaching laboratory. Participants will use online and local software to predict an active site within and protein structure, propose molecules which represent ligands or substrates for these proteins, and use docking software to predict binding site and affinity between one or more small molecules and their protein. While designed for junior/senior level undergraduates, these techniques are readily adaptable to introductory level chemistry and biology courses as well as at the high school level. They are based on free/open source software packages and web tools and require no specialized equipment beyond a standard computer setup. <br>
**Workshop cost:** $10. <br>
**Date and time:** TBD (July 31-Aug 4, 2022 at BCCE 2022), Purdue University,  West Lafayette, IN
