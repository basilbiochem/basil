## The BASIL Biochemistry Project

BASIL stands for Biochemistry Authentic Scientific Inquiry Lab. BASIL is designed for undergraduate biochemistry lab courses, but can be adapted to first year (or even high school) settings, as well as graduate coursework.  In BASIL students use in silico tools to predict the function of a protein and then use in vitro methods to study the protein in the lab. The curriculum is flexible and can be adapted to match the available facilities, the strengths of the instructor and the learning goals of an institution.
