## The BASIL Biochemistry Project

BASIL stands for Biochemistry Authentic Scientific Inquiry Lab. BASIL is designed for undergraduate biochemistry lab courses, but can be adapted to first year (or even high school) settings, as well as graduate coursework.  In BASIL students use in silico tools to predict the function of a protein and then use in vitro methods to study the protein in the lab. The BASIL curriculum consists of 11 modules which can be flexibly adapted to meet the needs and and talents of the instructor, work within the constraints of a variety of course structures, and target commonly assessed learning outcomes in biochemistry.
