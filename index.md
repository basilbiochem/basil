The BASIL Biochemistry Project provides curriculum and resources for use in a Course-Based Undergraduate Reserach Experience (CURE). BASIL is most often used in biochemistry courses, but can be adapted for other contexts. 

The curriculum is flexible and can be adapted to match the available facilities, the strengths of the instructor and the learning goals of a course and institution. These lessons are often used as part of upper-level laboratory coursework with at least one semester of biochemistry as a pre-requisite or co-requisite. The lab has been designed for classes ranging from 10-24 students (working in teams of two or three) per lab section. This lesson can be adapted to laboratory courses for introductory biology, cell and molecular biology, or advanced biology labs.
