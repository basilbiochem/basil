This curriculum from the [BASIL (Biochemistry Authentic Scientific Inquiry Laboratory) biochemistry consortium](https://basiliuse.blogspot.com/) aims to get students to transition from thinking like students to thinking like scientists. Students will analyze proteins with known structure but unknown function using computational analyses and wet-lab techniques. BASIL is designed for undergraduate biochemistry lab courses, but can be adapted to first year (or even high school) settings, as well as upper-level undergraduate or graduate coursework. It is targeted to students in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, or related majors. Further details about the BASIL biochemistry consortium can be found on the [BASIL blog](https://basiliuse.blogspot.com/).

The curriculum is flexible and can be adapted to match the available facilities, the strengths of the instructor and the learning goals of a course and institution. These lessons are often used as part of upper-level laboratory coursework with at least one semester of biochemistry as a pre-requisite or co-requisite. The lab has been designed for classes ranging from 10-24 students (working in teams of two or three) per lab section. This lesson can be adapted to laboratory courses for introductory biology, cell and molecular biology, or advanced biology labs.

## Additional Information for Instructors
Additional information for instructors is available to registered university faculty.  To register, [contact us](mailto:basilbiochem@gmail.com) from your university e-mail address and include your name, university affiliation, and the courses where you are considering using the BASIL curriculum.  Please use the subject line *BASIL Registration* for your e-mail. A starter kit of 10 plasmids that work well in this project is available for $25 from DNASu.
